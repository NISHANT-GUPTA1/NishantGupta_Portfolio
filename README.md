# Nishant Gupta — Product-focused Software Engineer

Hi — I'm Nishant. I build polished, high-performance web experiences and ship features end-to-end with product and design teams. My work focuses on clean engineering, measurable impact, and scalability. This repository contains my personal portfolio site (source, components, and project write-ups) used to showcase projects, case studies, and engineering samples.

If you're an engineering manager or recruiter at a product-driven company (FAANG / top-tier MNCs included), you'll find concise evidence here of technical depth, product sense, and collaboration at scale.

## Quick highlights

- Strong front-end engineering with modern TypeScript + React (Vite) stack
- Production-ready UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn-ui, with accessibility and performance in mind
- Product impact: shipped features that improved user engagement, conversion, and load times (see project notes)
- Cross-functional collaboration with PMs and designers; experience mentoring peers and driving RFCs

## What you'll find in this repo

- A responsive, accessible portfolio site built with React + TypeScript (source in src/)
- Selected project case studies with links to live demos and code samples
- Reusable UI components and small utilities that demonstrate pragmatic, testable design

## Live site

- [Portfolio (live)](https://nishantguptaportfolio.netlify.app/)

## Core technologies

- TypeScript
- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-ui

## Select projects (high level)

- ProjectsSection — Interactive portfolio pages that demonstrate component design, performance optimization, and attention to UX
- Hero3D — A small 3D demo showing performance tradeoffs, lazy-loading, and bundling strategies

## Hiring note (for recruiters / hiring managers)

- I'm interested in roles where I can own end-to-end features, improve platform reliability, and mentor others — mid to senior IC roles.
- To assess fit quickly: review this repo and the live site, then send a short role brief or a 20–30 minute sync invite. I can provide a tailored work sample or a short take-home aligned to your stack.
